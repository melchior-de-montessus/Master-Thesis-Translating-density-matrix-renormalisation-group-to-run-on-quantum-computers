This code is here as a complementary to my thesis paper "Translating density matrix renormalisation group to run on quantum computers". This thesis was performed during my fourth of MSci in Astrophysics at UCL under the supervision of Prof. Andrew Green. Each of the files correspond to a different section of the report where informations are given on how these were build.
