This code complements my thesis paper, "Translating density matrix renormalisation group to run on quantum computers". This thesis was performed during my fourth MSci in Astrophysics at UCL under the supervision of Prof. Andrew Green. Each file corresponds to a different section of the report, where information is given on how these were built.
